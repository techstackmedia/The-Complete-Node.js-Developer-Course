- Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
lightweight and efficient. 

Non-blocking I/O
I/O - whenever there's a communication with the outside world
I/O - communication with machine (reading some data from file on a filesystem)
I/O - communicate with some server (querying a database to fetch some record from database)
non-blocking - while node app waiting (querying the db), we can do other things.
- non-blocking is from the browser. It starts from the browser, otherwise the browser will 
completely freeze up whenever an I/O operation is happening

- event-driven is the process of registering those callback and having them called when 
the I/O operations is done.

- Node.js package ecosystem package ecosystem, npm is the largest ecosystem
of open source libraries in the world.
